Re-introduce the old "Repair" worktype, so now Construction and Repair are two different skills in the work-planner.

_________

Moves harvesting work type into the plant cutting category so you can now prioritize harvesting over sowing. As a counterbalance, trees can "harvest fail".

_________

Also contain a XML patches that makes "Stone Cutting" depending on the "Construction skill". Because "Stone Cutting" is giving XP in this skill.

> Be cautious to plan your work priorities accordingly.              
> Note that now harvesting wood on tree can fail.                           
> I highly recommend mixing it with XeoNovaDan's "[Plant cutting is for growers](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=29002)" which shows the relevant skills. - _Mehni_

### Thanks

Thanks to XeoNovaDan, it was while reading the code of "Plant Cutting is for Growers!" that I thought about that.

Thanks to (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ Mehni who provide the code for the planting/harvesting tweak
