		<description>Re-introduce the old "Repair" work type, so now Construction and Repair are two different skills in the work-planner.

Moves harvesting work type into the plant cutting category so you can now prioritize harvesting over sowing. As a counterbalance, trees can "harvest fail".

Also contain a XML patches that makes "Stone Cutting" depending on the "Construction skill" and bring back the old "Repair" work type.

=====================================================================

- Be cautious to plan your work priorities accordingly.
- Note that now harvesting wood on tree can fail.
- I highly recommend mixing it with XeoNovaDan's "Plant cutting is for growers" which shows the relevant skills. - Mehni</description>
